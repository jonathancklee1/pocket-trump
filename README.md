# Pocket Trump 

## Introduction
This is a web game based on a popular card game called Top Trumps, where the aim of the game is to play character cards against your opponent. Using the PokemonApi, I have turned the game into a Pokemon-themed version in which each Pokemon card will have its main stats like HP, ATTACK and DEFENCE as selectable game mechanics to battle. You will win the round by selecting the highest-numbered stat by comparing the opponent's respective stat of their card in play. If you win the round, the opponent's card will be added to the back of your hand; if you lose, your card in play will be added to their hand. Gaining all the cards in the game in your hand will allow you to beat your opponent
